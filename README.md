# UFOs
## Overview of Project
  After Dana’s webpage and dynamic table has worked as intended, I've helped her to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I’ve added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
  In the newly created webpage, users will see a title, subtitle, and a small summary paragraph to explain a little bit about the UFOs and ask some random open-ended questions. This is followed by a large table which includes information about the major events that happened in the United States and Canada. All the comments and events durations can be easily filtered by the users by choosing the date, city, country, and state of these events from the small filtering bozes on the left of the webpage as we see in the following image.

  For example, if we want to get the major UFO events that have happened in Canada, we can see the following results:

## Summary
### Drawbacks:
 - Very limited data

### Recommendations:
 - Expand the data search by looking for many other recent events in the world
 - Include more visualizations like images and graphs that make the webpage more readable and real
